<body><h1><i>THE LIFE STORY OF SACHIN TENDULKAR</i></h1>
<img src="sachin.jpg" width="200px" heigth="200px" align="top">
<h2 align="left">Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar</h2>
<p align="justify">Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 to a Maharashtrian family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry. Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child</p>

<p class="ten"> .He is an Indian former international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket. Considered as the world's most prolific batsman of all time,he is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.</p>
<p>
Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.He is colloquially known as <Little Master or Master Blaster.</p>

<h3>Tendulkar's Family</h3>
<p>On 24 May 1995, Tendulkar married Anjali Mehta  a paediatrician of Gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990.They have a daughter Sara and a son Arjun .Sara Tendulkar was born on the 12th of October 1997, and Arjun Tendulkar was born on 24 September 1999. The elder one, Sara is a graduate in Medicine from University College London.The younger one, Arjun Tendulkar, is an aspiring cricketer. But unlike Tendulkar, he is well above 6 ft and has all the reasons to become a bowler. Arjun is a left-arm pacer and batsman who has been bowling to international players in the nets at different venues in the world. He claimed a staggering 19 wickets in just 5 games for Mumbai Under-19 in the 2017-18 Cooch Behar Trophy. Arjun seems to have maturely accepted his fate of persistent limelight on him. The 19-year old has kept his composure and worked hard to make it to the U-19 Indian team. If he does make it to the Indian National Team, the pressure will rise even further with the expectations of a billion fans and legacy of one Sachin Tendulkar. </p>

In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.Sachin has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.</p>
<h2>Revisit India's historic 2011 ICC World Cup </h2>
<img src="group.jpg" align="top">

<p>The 2011 World Cup was Sachin Tendulkar's last chance to win a World Cup before he retired from ODI's. The master blaster had waited 22 years for lifting the trophy and said it was the proudest moment of his life.

Sri Lanka made the most of their opportunity while batting first and gave India a stiff target of 275. During the chase, fans were left emotionally battered after Lasith Malinga dismissed local boy Sachin Tendulkar, leaving India at a precarious 31/2 in the 6th over. A heroic innings by Gautam Gambhir along with an exceptional captain's knock from Dhoni saved India the blushes and saw Dhoni and Co. lift the World Cup after 28 years.

The celebrations that night continued until the wee hours of the morning. The tri-colour was flying high and it was truly a moment for every Indian to cherish. It was no denying that April 2, 2011 was one of the greatest moments of Indian cricket. Star Sports invites viewers to experience ball to ball action and join the Indian team in lifting the World Cup once again.
